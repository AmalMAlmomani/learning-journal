# The 4 parts of a computer :
  - Input:converts physical input to binary information (GPS, keyboard,..)
  - CPU:central processing unit calculates information( multiple CPU)
  - Memory:stores information (many gigabit)
  - Output:converts information to physical output(screen, sound,video, games,..)
  
  ## Circuits and logical 
   - million of tiny electronic components which come together to form circuits
   - everything you can do with technology
   
 ### Bit: the smallest piece of information a computer can store
 - computer works on ONES & ZEROES
 - inside the computer : wires & circuits
 - with more bits you can represent more complex information 
 - Decimal number system 
 - Binary number system
 
 ### 4 things are common to all computer:
    take input , store information , processing , output the result.

 ### Hardware: stuff, circuits, chips, wires, speakers
 
 ### Software: all programming code running on machine (Apps, games, website, maps, creative, Analysis)
 
 ### CPU: master chip that content all the other parts of the computer 
     - which circuits to use
     - when to use
 
### Operating System: the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer
