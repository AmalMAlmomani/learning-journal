# Introducing CSS

- **CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear.**
- **A CSS rule contains two parts:** *a selector and a declaration.*
- CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.
  - `<link>`:It is an empty element (meaning it does not need a closing tag), and it lives inside the `<head>` element.
   - href: This specifies the path to the CSS file
   - rel: This specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to. The value should be stylesheet when linking to a CSS file.
 - external CSS style sheet. This:
   - Allows all pages to use the same style rules (rather than repeating them in each page).
   - Keeps the content separate from how the page looks.
   - Means you can change the styles used across all pages by altering just one file (rather than each individual page).
 
 - **CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.**
 - **Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).**
 - **Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.**
 - **Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.**
 - **CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.**
