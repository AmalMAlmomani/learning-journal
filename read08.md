## Comparison and logical operators
- **EVALUATIONS**: You can analyze values in your scripts to determine whether or note they match expected results. 
- **DECISIONS**: Using the results of evaluations, you can decide which path your script should go down.
- **LOOPS**:There are also many occasions where you will want to perform the same set of steps repeatedly. 

### There are two components to a decision:
  - 1. An expression is evaluated, which returns a value.
  - 2. A conditional statement says what to do in a given situation.

**Comparison operators:**
  - == , is equal to 
  - != , is not equal to 
  - === , strict equal to
  - !== , strict not equal to
  - && , logical and
  - || , logical or 
  - ! , logical not 
  
  
##  IF STATEMENTS: 
   - evaluates or checks a condition.
   
   
## If..ELSE STATEMENTS 
   - There is no need to provide an el se option. (You can just use an if statement.) 
## SWITCH STATEMENTS
   - A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value.Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value. 
   -  (providing better performance than multiple if statements).
 
## Loop counters :
   - For loop
   -  While loops
