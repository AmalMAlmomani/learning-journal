 ### The Defference Between Text Editors and IDEs:
  
  - Text Editor: kind of gives away what it does in the title.
     1. edit text
     2. manages text
     3. manages file
     
  - IDE(Integrated Development Environment): suite of different software all coming together.
      1. text editor 
      2. file manager 
      3. dubugger all in one software package 
   
   ` IDE very much like Microsoft outlook`
   
 ## Linux Tutorial 
  1. The Command Line
     * Opening a Terminal: If you are on Windows and intend to remotely log into another machine then you will need an SSH client. A rather good one is Putty (free).
     * The Shell, Bash: that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you.
     * Shortcuts:Here's your first shortcut. When you enter commands, they are actually stored in a history. You can traverse this history using the up and down arrow keys. So don't bother re-typing out commands you have previously entered, you can usually just hit the up arrow a few times. You can also edit these commands using the left and right arrow keys to move the cursor where you want.
  2. Navigation
     * So where are we? pwd: tells you what your current or present working directory is.
       - Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.
     * What's in Our Current Location?  ls: It's short for list, It's one thing to know where we are.
       - List the contents of a directory.
       - ls [options] [location]
     `Whereas pwd is just run by itself with no arguments, ls is a little more powerful.` 
     * Absolute and Relative Paths: we refer to a file or directory we are using one of these paths, 
       -  At the very top of the structure is what's called the *root* directory. It is denoted by a single slash ( / ).
       - Relative path: A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.
       - Absolute path: A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.
     * cd: Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.
       - cd [location]
     * ` you may hit the Tab key on your keyboard at any time which will invoke an auto complete action.`
  3. More About Files
    * ` everything is actually a file. A text file is a file, a directory is a file, your keyboard is a file (one that the system reads from only), your monitor is a file (one that the system writes to only) etc.* 
  
 ### The following are common extensions:
      - file.exe - an executable file, or program.
      - file.txt - a plain text file.
      - file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.
      - file [path]
      
   1. file: obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
   2. ls -a: List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
   
  ### Important Concepts:
      - Everything is a file under Linux, Even directories.
      - Linux is an extensionless system, Files can have any extension they like or none at all.
      - Linux is case sensitive, Beware of silly typos.
