# Javascript

## PROPERTIES: Properties describe characteristics of the current web page 
### METHODS: Methods perform tasks associated with the document currently loaded in the browser 

### HOW A BROWSER SEES A WEB PAGE:
   - 1. RECEIVE A PAGE AS HTML CODE 
   - 2. CREATE A MODEL OF THE PAGE AND STORE IT IN MEMORY 
   - 3. USE A RENDERING ENGINE TO SHOW THE PAGE ON SCREEN
  
 **How do computers fit in with the world around them?**
   - computers create models of the world using data.
   - programmers can write code to say "When this event occurs, run that code."
   - To make web pages interactive, you write code that uses the browsers model of the web page;
   
  **How do I write a script for a web page?**

  - It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file.JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the .j s extension.
  - The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).
  - If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created. 
  
 **comments**: //explain what your code does.
 
 **A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.**
