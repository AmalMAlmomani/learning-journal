### A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
  - To write a script, you need to `first` state your goal and `then` list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. 

**Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.**
  - 1. DEFINE THE GOAL
  - 2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT 
       - This can be represented using a flowchart.
  - 3. CODE EACH STEP 
  
- Vocabulary: The words that computers understand
- Syntax: How you put those words together to create instructions computers can follow 
- what might have gone wrong - programmers call this **debugging**. 

## Expressions + Operators

**Here are six rules you must always follow when giving a variable a name:**
 1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_).
 2. The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_).
    -  Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name. 
 3. You cannot use keywords or reserved words. 
 4. All variables are case sensitive
 5. Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores.
 6. If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word.
 
- **An array**: is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.
- Each item in an array:** is automatically given a number called an index
- An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.
- Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
- There are many occasions where you may need to join two or more strings to create a single value. Programmers call the process of joining together two or more strings to create one new string concatenation.
 
 
 ## Functions:
  - Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
